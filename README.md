# YOLO Object Detection 🚀

This project implements **YOLO-based Object Detection** to identify objects in **images, videos, and live camera streams**. It is trained with a custom dataset and deployed as a **web application** where users can upload images or videos to detect objects in real-time.


## 🔹 Features
- 📸 **Image Detection** – Upload images to detect objects.  
- 🎥 **Video Detection** – Process videos and highlight detected objects.  
- 📡 **Live Detection** – Capture and analyze real-time camera streams.  
- 🌐 **Web Interface** – Simple webpage to upload files and view results.  
- ✅ **Custom Training** – Model trained on dataset for accurate predictions.  


## 🔹 Tech Stack
- **Platform:** Google Colab  
- **Languages:** Python, HTML (embedded in Streamlit)  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `cv2`, `matplotlib`, `ultralytics` (YOLOv8)  
  - `PIL` (Image Processing)  
  - `numpy`, `pandas`, `pathlib`  
  - `streamlit` (Web UI)  
- **Others:** `ngrok` for secure tunneling and authentication
